  {
    question: 'What is LTL (Less Than Truckload) shipping?',
    answer: 'LTL shipping is a cost-effective freight transportation method where multiple shippers share space on a single truck. This is ideal when your shipment doesn\'t require a full truckload, typically for freight between 150-15,000 pounds. LTL carriers consolidate shipments from multiple customers traveling along similar routes, making it more affordable than booking an entire truck.',

  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between LTL and TL (Truckload) shipping?',
    answer: 'TL (Truckload) shipping means your freight occupies the entire truck, offering faster transit times and dedicated service without additional stops. LTL (Less Than Truckload) means sharing truck space with other shippers, making multiple stops along the route. TL is best for large shipments (10,000+ pounds or 10+ pallets), while LTL is ideal for smaller shipments that don\'t require a full truck.',
